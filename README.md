# fitness-tracker-Rajesh-R
This is a "Streamlit web application" in Python that predicts "calories burned" during exercise using user inputs. The application enables users to input parameters like "age, BMI, duration, heart rate, body temperature, and gender". The application predicts calories burned through the use of "Random Forest Regression" using a dataset of exercise information. It also offers "comparative insights" by viewing how the user's parameters stack up against others in the dataset. Also, the app shows "similar results" from the dataset and has a "progress bar animation" for user experience.
